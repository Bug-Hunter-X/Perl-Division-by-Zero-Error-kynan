# Perl Division by Zero Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: division by zero.  The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, which results in a runtime error. The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a corrected version that handles the potential for division by zero.

## How to Reproduce

1. Save the code in `bug.pl`.
2. Run it using `perl bug.pl`.
3. Observe the runtime error.

## Solution

The solution involves checking if the divisor is zero before performing the division.  See `bugSolution.pl` for the corrected code.
